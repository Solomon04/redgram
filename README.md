# PHP Redgram
PHP Redgram is a command line tool written in PHP, specifically [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/), that allows you to post content from Reddit to Instagram programmatically. I use this for
my Instagram account [@icodestuff.io](https://www.instagram.com/icodestuff.io) as it takes the hassle of having to find content. 

### How It Works
After you have setup the application, Redgram pulls content from a subreddit of your choice (image or video), sends an email to you asking if you want to post to your Instagram account, if you reply to the email with yes, Redgram will post to your Instagram. As I mentioned before we use [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/), a command line tool written by [Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro) so it can be run as a scheduled cron job. I personally have it setup running every three hours on my server so I can keep my followers engaged.
